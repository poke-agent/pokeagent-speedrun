# Introduction

After the title screen, the resident researcher of the Hoenn region, Professor Birch, appears and introduces new Trainers to the Pokémon world. The professor continues, asking the player to select both a gender and a name, which can be up to seven characters long. With that done, Birch sends the player off to begin their journey!

# Home

The game begins in the back of a moving truck, as your family has just moved here from the far-off Johto region. Hop out of the truck to meet Mom and step inside your new home. Head upstairs to check out your room and set the clock. Return to the first floor and Mom excitedly calls you over to the TV; the current program just aired a segment about the Petalburg Gym, where your dad is the new Gym Leader. She then suggests visiting his friend, your new neighbor, Professor Birch. Welcome to Littleroot Town!

# Littleroot Town

Littleroot is a quaint little town nestled on the lush southern edge of the Hoenn mainland. There are only three buildings here; your home, Professor Birch's home, and the professor's Pokémon Laboratory, where he conducts research on Pokémon distribution, in the south.

## Items
- **Potion** - Retrievable from the PC in the player's room

## Professor Birch's House

Having just moved to a new town, why not meet your new neighbors? Visit the house next door to meet the professor's wife, then head upstairs to meet his child. The room is empty at first, but inspect the item on the floor and May/Brendan enters. Your new friend introduces herself/himself but suddenly leaves, remembering that Birch asked for help in catching a Pokémon.

# Route 101

Route 101 is a short path that connects Littleroot Town to Oldale Town in the north. The route features several patches of tall grass, a favorite hiding place of wild Pokémon.

## Save the Professor!

When you first reach the area, you find Professor Birch being chased around by a wild Zigzagoon! His Bag has fallen out of his reach, and he pleads with you for help. Choose one of the three Pokémon from the Poké Balls inside the professor's Bag, and use it to scare off his attacker.

### Attacking Birch (Cannot be caught, due to having no Poké Balls)
- **Zigzagoon** - Level 2 (One encounter)

## Starter Pokémon Choice

### Treecko (Grass type)
- Evolves into **Grovyle** (Grass type)
- Evolves into **Sceptile** (Grass type)

The Grass-type Treecko has the most weaknesses of the trio, with five: Fire-, Bug-, Poison-, Flying-, and Ice-type attacks. It and its Evolutions excel in Special Attack and Speed. Its Grass moves are strong against Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokémon, though they have relatively low base powers.

### Torchic (Fire type)
- Evolves into **Combusken** (Fire/Fighting type)
- Evolves into **Blaziken** (Fire/Fighting type)

The Fire-type Torchic is great when battling Grass-, Bug-, Ice-, and Steel-type Pokémon, but is vulnerable to Water- and Ground-type moves. It and its evolved forms focus on Attack and Special Attack. As it grows, it gains a secondary Fighting type, making it better against Normal, Rock, and Dark-types.

### Mudkip (Water type)
- Evolves into **Marshtomp** (Water/Ground type)
- Evolves into **Swampert** (Water/Ground type)

The Water-type Mudkip has an advantage when facing Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-type Pokémon, but may struggle against Grass and Electric attacks. It and its Evolutions specialize in Attack. As it grows, it gains a secondary Ground type, which protects it from Electric attacks and also gives an advantage over Poison and Steel-types. Grass attacks, its one remaining weakness, is uncommon in Emerald. Mudkip is notably able to learn Surf when other Pokémon are still relying on much weaker attacks.

# Littleroot Town

## Birch's Lab

After scaring off the wild Pokémon, Birch invites you back to the Lab. As thanks for rescuing him, he happily lets you keep the young Pokémon. He then encourages you to visit May/Brendan on Route 103 for tips on how to be a Pokémon Trainer. When your Pokémon needs a rest, head back home and visit with Mom to have her restore it to full health.

# Route 101

Route 103, need to take Route 101 to Oldale Town. With ledges blocking the way, you must go through the tall grass to keep moving north. Pokémon can be battled, but not captured, seeing as you don't have any Poké Balls yet.

- **Wurmple** - Level 2-3 (45%)

# Oldale Town

Oldale Town is the first settlement in the region to feature a Pokémon Center and a Poké Mart. Pokémon Centers are essentially hospitals where creatures can be restored to perfect health. The PC on the counter is always available for Trainers to organize their Pokémon. Poké Marts offer a wide range of items for sale, from Potions to Poké Balls. Route 102 leads off to the west, while Route 103 runs northward.

## Items

## The Sketch Artist

The western exit is currently blocked off by a man who believes that he may have found some extremely rare Pokémon tracks. No one is allowed past until he has made a sketch of his discovery.

Now that you have received some Poké Balls, they can be purchased at all Poké Marts in the region. Buying ten Poké Balls at once, at any location, also earns you a bonus Premier Ball.

## Meet up with Mom

As you go to leave Littleroot, you see Mom standing outside. She is proud that you have your own Pokémon. In preparation for your adventure, she gives you a pair of Running Shoes. By holding down the B Button, these shoes allow you to run twice as fast as the normal walking speed.

Collect the fruit and the trees disappear, allowing you to plant another Berry to continue the cycle. The amount of time needed for the new tree to fully mature and produce fruit varies based on the kind of Berry. After obtaining a watering can, you may water the young plants at certain times to increase the Berry yield. Berries can have several useful effects, from curing status conditions to restoring health. They can even be turned into candy!

# Petalburg City (first visit)

Situated between Route 102 to the east and Route 104 to the west, Petalburg City is the first location you reach to feature a Pokémon Gym.

## Meet up with Dad

When you visit the Petalburg Gym, you find your father, Norman, standing in the lobby. He is surprised that you've made it this far from home but is excited that you are becoming a Pokémon Trainer like him. A sickly boy named Wally soon enters, and explains that he will be staying with relatives in nearby Verdanturf Town in the hopes that the clean air will do him good. He is afraid of becoming lonely there and asks for help in catching a Pokémon to take along. Norman asks that you go with him and loans him his Zigzagoon and a Poké Ball. Wally leads you back to Route 102, where he successfully catches a Ralts.

Back at the Gym, Wally can't thank you enough for helping him catch his very own Pokémon. Your father then gives you some advice: to become a strong Trainer, challenge Gym Leader Roxanne in Rustboro City before moving on to the other Gym Leaders. Though Norman is also a Gym Leader, he will not accept your challenge until you have earned four Badges.

## The Man in Sunglasses

As you reach the city's western limit, you are stopped by a man in sunglasses. Judging by the way you are dressed, he assumes that you're a Pokémon Trainer. However, he reconsiders after seeing your not-so-dirty clothes, determining you to be either a rookie Trainer or just an ordinary kid. He informs you that he is roaming the land in search of powerful Trainers, and apologizes for taking your time before leaving for Route 104.


# Route 104 (south)

Route 104 connects Petalburg City with Petalburg Woods to the north and Route 105 to the south. A cottage belonging to Mr. Briney is located on the south side.

After explaining that he is looking for a Shroomish, he is suddenly confronted by a member of Team Aqua. The thug had planned to ambush the worker when he left the woods, but grew too impatient for that. Defeat him in battle and he flees the scene, but not before hinting that his friends are up to something in Rustboro. The grateful researcher gives you a Great Ball as thanks. He then rushes off to Rustboro after realizing what his attacker wanted.

## Devon Corporation

Devon Corporation is headquartered in a large stone building in the northwest part of town. The company is responsible for manufacturing many of the items Trainers rely on every day, including several variations of Poké Ball and medicine. Only authorized personnel are allowed past the first floor.

### Status Ailments Reference

| Ailment | Effect(s) |
|---------|-----------|
| **BURNED** | Attack drops to 50%, inflicts damage equal to 1/8 of maximum HP every turn. Fire-type Pokémon are immune to this condition. |

## The Man in Sunglasses

Just inside the entrance, you find the Man in Sunglasses again, who introduces himself as Scott. He's been searching everywhere for outstanding Trainers, specifically Pokémon battle experts. He wonders what brings you here to school, and claims that the first thing you should do as a new Trainer is teach Cut to one of your Pokémon. It's a useful field move, but using it outside of battle requires the badge from the local Gym.

It is advisable to talk to Scott every time you see him at each location that appears throughout the game as you will get a Battle Frontier reward later.

## Time for a Trade

The Rustboro Gym beckons, but before you step inside, visit the house to the east. Inside is a boy who is looking to trade his Seedot for a Ralts. Seedot is a Grass Pokémon that eventually evolves into a Grass/Dark Pokémon, Shiftry. This one is even holding a Chesto Berry to sweeten the deal.

## Rustboro Gym

**Rustboro City Pokémon Gym**
**Leader: Roxanne - The ROCK-loving honor student!**

The Rustboro Gym specializes in Rock-type Pokémon. Use Grass, Water, and Fighting moves, such as Water Gun and Bullet Seed, to deal serious damage, and avoid battling with Fire-, Bug-, or Flying-type Pokémon. As hers is the first Gym in the Hoenn League, this graduate of the Pokémon Trainer's School has opted for a layout that gives novice Trainers a chance to avoid her subordinates and challenge the Gym Leader directly. Use Defense-lowering moves like Leer to soften up Roxanne's rock-solid Pokémon, and moves like Growl to weaken their Attack. As Rock/Ground Pokémon, her two Geodude are especially vulnerable to Grass and Water moves, sustaining 4× the normal amount of damage.

### Trainers
- **Youngster Josh** - Geodude ♂, Level 10
- **Youngster Tommy** - Geodude ♂, Level 8 (×2) - Potential Double Battle with Marc
- **Hiker Marc** - Geodude ♂, Level 8 (×2) - Potential Double Battle with Tommy

### Gym Leader Roxanne
**Prize: 1500 Pokédollars**

- **Geodude** (Rock/Ground) ♀, Level 12
  - Ability: Rock Head
  - Moves: Tackle, Defense Curl, Rock Throw, Rock Tomb

- **Geodude** (Rock/Ground) ♀, Level 12
  - Ability: Rock Head
  - Moves: Tackle, Defense Curl, Rock Throw, Rock Tomb

- **Nosepass** (Rock) ♀, Level 15
  - Ability: Sturdy
  - Held Item: Oran Berry
  - Moves: Block, Harden, Tackle, Rock Tomb

After the battle, Roxanne awards you the Stone Badge, which boosts your Pokémon's Attack by 10% and enables the use of Cut in the field. She also gives you TM39 Rock Tomb as a prize.

## Stop, Thief!

When you leave the Gym, you witness a Team Aqua Grunt escaping from the Devon Corporation building. That same Devon researcher from earlier is close behind, and chases the thief northward. He loses track of him in the northeast, where the city connects to Route 116.
